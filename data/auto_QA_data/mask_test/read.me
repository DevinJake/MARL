The full testing dataset has more than 150k questions.
We processed all the 150k+ testing questions and saved the processed question in the file FINAL_MAML_test.question, which is used for testing.
Also, we randomly sampled 5 percent of all the testing questions, and stored them in the file SAMPLE_FINAL_MAML_test.question.
We found that the test result of the sampled testing question approximated that of all the testing questions.
If the researcher wants to quickly evaluate the performance of the model, we recommend using the sample data set.

The dataset is using the evenly-distributed annotation dataset for both seq2seq training and REINFORCE training.
The vocabulary is the same vocab as used in unevenly distributed mask dataset.
The PT_train dataset is used for supervised learning, the RL_train dataset is utilized for REINFOERCE by using BLEU as reward and the RL_train_TR (True Reward) is used for training REINFORCE by using F1 as reward.
